Student Course Registration System

A Java Swing–based desktop application that allows students to register for courses and admins to manage courses and monitor registrations, backed by a MySQL database.

📌 Project Overview

The Student Course Registration System is designed to automate the manual process of course enrollment.
It provides role-based access where:

👨‍🎓 Students can view courses, register, drop courses, and see their registered subjects.
